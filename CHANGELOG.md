## Features

### Font customization

Option to set different fonts for application interface and article content. In this version, I have added few variations of the Roboto font and Lato font as possible choices. If you know other fonts that can be used then please let me know about them.

### TeslaUnread integration

You can enable this feature to sync unread article counts in the background and display them as application badge. Note that this only works with TeslaUnread. Please send me a message if you are aware of similar "applications" that could be integrated.

### Other

- Option to set toggling of article read state as Floating Action Button action
- Option to autoplay gifs in article list
- Option to automatically check for new content after marking all articles as read

## Improvements

### Better scrolling and toolbar auto-hiding

I've rewritten how the toolbar and header auto-hiding works to fix issues with status-bar. It no longer covers the top of the article content and stays colored after toolbar/header collapses to follow the behavior in other applications.

Another improvement coming from this change is the fixed handling of multiple fingers. Now you should be able to use more than one finger to scroll the content without any issues.

### Other

- Fixed crashes when loading full content

# <a id="v0.17.4">0.17.4 - Colorful scroll edges (Jan 29, 2017)</a>
## Improvements

### Colorful scroll edges

Improved all of the scroll edge glow effects. Now they should be colored to match the application theme instead of always being green! (Android Lollipop and higher)

### New articles full content parser

I decided to change the full content parser used by SwipeNews. This new one should give much better results for some of the sites. Thanks for showing me it.

### Better color animations

When changing accent color all the colors are now nicely animating similar to how it's done when changing primary color. In addition, the circles showing currently selected color also animate.

### Link in long-press actions menu

Made the link in long-press actions menu selectable so you cal freely copy just a part of it. Also changed its scroll direction to horizontal which feels much easier to use and improves the look by having its top and bottom always aligned.

### Other improvements

- Improved the screen animations in settings to avoid displaying ugly black background noticeable in light themes

## Bug fixes

- Fixed the long-press highlight hotspot position. Now it should appear inside of the article items when canceling long-press
- Fixed the direction of volume key navigation in article content screen. Pressing volume down should now go to the next instead of the previous article. Similar for volume up button.
- Fixed the issue where marking an article as read when opening in the browser wouldn't update unread counter. This should also fix few other cases where the unread counter is not updated when switching between applications.
- Fixed text wrapping issues in code blocks
- Fixed the default action for swipe left gesture
- Fixed toolbar height in landscape orientation
- Fixed sliders in settings not changing when modifying accent color
- Fixed some issues with loading unread counts

# <a id="v0.17.0">0.17.0 - Toolbar unread counter (Jan 11, 2017)</a>
## Features

### Unread articles count in toolbar

Shows the amount of articles that are unread inside of a badge located in the toolbar. Available both in list and content screens and can be disabled with a setting. 

### Rewrite of article content screen

This is a huge change which took a lot of time for this update. It was done in order to improve the loading and scrolling performance in that screen and also to make it more stable. There is a list of improvements and new features coming with it:

- Better performance when sliding between articles and when scrolling content 
- Improved stability when content contains many images or long content
- Long press and keep holding on toolbar in content screen to peek header 
- Improved header collapsing behavior 
- Got rid of occasional white screen flash before content is loaded in dark themes 

Please report any issues with it as that change required a lot of changes to get it right and I might have missed some bugs. 

### Mark as read on scroll setting split

This option was previously affecting both, scrolling within articles list and content screen. Now you can customize them separately. Note that due to this change the previous option you've selected now affects only articles list and marking as read in content screen is turned on for everyone.

### Volume-keys navigation

Available in 3 options:

- Navigate to next/previous article in list screen
- Navigate to next/previous article in content screen 
- Scroll article content

All of these options are disabled by default. 

## Improvements

This update brings only a single but very important change:

**Fixed terrible performance drop introduced in the latest version.**

 I found out that I've accidentally created an infinite loop on the main screen which was slowing down the whole application. I'm really sorry for that. Hopefully, SwipeNews should be as fast as before.

# <a id="v0.16.0">0.16.0 - Article starring (Dec 9, 2016)</a>
## Features

- Article starring
Comes with a section in navigation drawer to view all starred items, option to select article starring as any article action and also option to select it as action in content screen's floating action button. It's going to be a default action for new users - existing should check the settings to use it.
Additionally, there is now visible a small star indicator which indicates when articles are starred.
